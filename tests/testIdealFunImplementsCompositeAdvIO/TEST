description 
This test fails becuase a real functionality implements a composite

(given second). Here A is composite interface of a basic adversarial
interface I
.
args: testIdealFunImplementsCompositeAdvIO.uc
outcome: failure
[error: testIdealFunImplementsCompositeAdvIO.uc: from line 18 columns 32 to 33]

adversarial interface must be basic: A
